<h1 align="center"> Comparing Strings Using Recursion </h1>

## Description 
- The tester method test the comparison of two strings and the findMinimum Recursion method to find the smaller string value. 
The output prints that the two tests ran successfully. Look at Example1.

- The main method defines 4 strings and compares them. The output is either a -1, 1, or 0. 
-1 = left string is smaller, 1 = right string is greater, 0 = equal. Look at Example2

- In addition, four strings are added to the ArrayList in main and the final output represents, the minimum value in the array. 4 of the comparisons. Look at Example2
